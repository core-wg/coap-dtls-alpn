1.  Introduction

   [RFC9460] specifies the "SVCB" ("Service Binding") DNS resource
   records for looking up communication endpoints of a service.  Service
   Parameters (SvcParams) are used to carry that information.  This
   document specifies which information from SvcParams can be used with
   CoAP services that are secured by transport security, namely TLS and
   DTLS.  As an example, this information can be obtained as part of the
   discovery of DNS over CoAP (DoC) servers (see
   [I-D.ietf-core-dns-over-coap]) that deploy TLS or DTLS to secure
   their messages.

2.  Terminology

   SvcParams denotes the field in either DNS SVCB/HTTPS records as
   defined in [RFC9460], or DHCP and RA messages as defined in
   [RFC9463].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) IDs

   [RFC9460] defines the "alpn" key, which is used to identify the
   service binding to a protocol suite using its Application-Layer
   Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) ID [RFC7301].  For CoAP over TLS an ALPN
   ID was defined in [RFC8323].  As it is not advisable to re-use the
   same ALPN ID for a different transport layer, an ALPN for CoAP over
   DTLS is also registered in Section 5.  To discover CoAP services that
   secure their messages with TLS or DTLS, these ALPN IDs can be used in
   the same manner as for any other service secured with transport layer
   security, as described in [RFC9460].  Other authentication mechanisms
   are currently out of scope.

4.  Security Considerations

   Any security considerations on SVCB resource records (see [RFC9460]),
   also apply to this document.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  TLS ALPN for CoAP

   The following entry has been added to the "TLS Application-Layer
   Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs" registry, which is part of
   the "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions" group.

   *  Protocol: CoAP (over DTLS)

   *  Identification sequence: 0x63 0x6f ("co")

   *  Reference: [RFC7252] and [this document]

   Note that [RFC7252] does not define the use of the ALPN TLS extension
   during connection the DTLS handshake.  This document does not change
   that, and thus does not establish any rules like those in Section 8.2
   of [RFC8323].
