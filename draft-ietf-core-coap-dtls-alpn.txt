1.  Introduction

   Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) enable communicating
   parties to agree on an application-layer protocol during a Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) handshake using an ALPN ID.  This ALPN ID can be
   discovered for services as part of Service Bindings (SVCB) via the
   DNS, using SVCB resource records with the "alpn" Service Parameter
   Keys.  As an example, this information can be obtained as part of the
   discovery of DNS over CoAP (DoC) servers (see
   [I-D.ietf-core-dns-over-coap]) that deploy TLS or DTLS to secure
   their messages.  This document specifies an ALPN ID for CoAP services
   that are secured by transport security using DTLS.  An ALPN ID for
   CoAP service secured by TLS has already been specified in [RFC8323].

2.  Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) IDs

   For CoAP over TLS an ALPN ID was defined as "coaps" in [RFC8323].  As
   it is not advisable to re-use the same ALPN ID for a different
   transport layer, an ALPN for CoAP over DTLS is registered in
   Section 4.

   ALPN ID values have variable length.  Here, a short value ("co") is
   allocated for CoAP over DTLS, as this can avoid fragmentation of
   Client Hello and Server Hello messages in constrained networks with
   link-layer fragmentation, such as 6LoWPAN [RFC4944].

   To discover CoAP services that secure their messages with TLS or
   DTLS, ALPN IDs "coaps" and "co" can be used respectively in the same
   manner as for any other service secured with transport layer
   security, as described in [RFC9460].  Other authentication mechanisms
   are currently out of scope.

3.  Security Considerations

   Any security considerations on ALPN (see [RFC7301]) and SVCB resource
   records (see [RFC9460]), also apply to this document.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  TLS ALPN for CoAP

   The following entry has been added to the "TLS Application-Layer
   Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs" registry, which is part of
   the "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions" group.

   *  Protocol: CoAP (over DTLS)

   *  Identification sequence: 0x63 0x6f ("co")

   *  Reference: [RFC7252] and [this document]

   Note that [RFC7252] does not define the use of the ALPN TLS extension
   during the DTLS connection handshake.  This document does not change
   this behavior, and thus does not establish any rules like those in
   Section 8.2 of [RFC8323].
